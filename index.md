## About
Currently, I am employed as a Solution Engineer specializing in Control and AI systems at Volvo Car Corporation, based in Gothenburg, Sweden.

I received the Ph.D. degree in Robotics, Control & Artificial Intelligence from the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, in 2022. Before that, I received the M.Sc. degree from the Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Mécanique et d’Aérotechnique, Poitiers, France, in 2018, and the B.Eng. degree from the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 2015, both in Aerospace Engineering.

## Interests
- **Robotic Systems**: Development, modeling, simulation, and intelligent control of novel robots, smart sensors, and actuators.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Safety and reliability of artificial intelligence in safety-critical systems, with a focus on autonomous driving.
- **Systems Engineering**: Model-based systems engineering, large language models for Requirements engineering.
